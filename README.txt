Frogger Project


Disclosure:

This project is part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree curriculum. Some of the code,
including code in (engine.js and resources.js) was not written by me.
Almost all of the code I wrote is in app.js. The code I was given can be found at:
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game. I forked this repository,
so you can see the exact code I wrote by taking the diff between the 2 commits.


How to run the game:

1) Open index.html
2) Use the arrow keys to move the player
